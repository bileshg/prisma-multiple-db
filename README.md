# Prisma Multiple Databases Example

This is a proof-of-concept project that demonstrates how to use Prisma ORM to interact with two different databases (in this example, SQLite & PostgreSQL) in a TypeScript application. The example includes seeding databases and querying them to retrieve and display related data.

Please refer to [this](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/2443) GitHub issue for more details.
